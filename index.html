      <p>
        I was born in Chicago, IL on May 9th. Though I was raised in the south suburbs, I went to grammar school and junior high in the city. I'm a big homebody and love spending time with my pets; one dog and three cats. I have an obsession with tattoos. I currently have 12 and I'm looking to get more. I also love to dance, read, play video games and watch anime. In the next 5 years, I'd like to transition to working remotely and move out of the country.
